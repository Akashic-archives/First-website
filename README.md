# First-website

My first website, just messing around with linux, python and html.

The end goal is to create websites fast and deploy them on a local machine for experience.

I shift towards a self-hosted buisness, the name would be "Pc Wizard", I will do free diagnostic and charge always cheaper that the competition, I will put "samples before pay" to prove the work is done before reciving any money, and I will think of how I will interact with the customer's pc/hardware.
